IESG Note

   This extension to the POP3 protocol is to be used by a server to
   express policy descisions taken by the server administrator.  It is
   not an endorsement of implementations of further POP3 extensions
   generally.  It is the general view that the POP3 protocol should stay
   simple, and for the simple purpose of downloading email from a mail
   server.  If more complicated operations are needed, the IMAP protocol
   [<a href="rfc2060.html">RFC 2060</a>] should be used.  The first paragraph of section 7 should
   be read very carefully.

1.  Introduction

   The Post Office Protocol version 3 [POP3] is very widely used.
   However, while it includes some optional commands (and some useful
   protocol extensions have been published), it lacks a mechanism for
   advertising support for these extensions or for behavior variations.

   Currently these optional features and extensions can only be detected
   by probing, if at all.  This is at best inefficient, and possibly
   worse.  As a result, some clients have manual configuration options
   for POP3 server capabilities.

   Because one of the most important characteristics of POP3 is its
   simplicity, it is desirable that extensions be few in number (see
   section 7).  However, some extensions are necessary (such as ones
   that provide improved security [POP-AUTH]), while others are very
   desirable in certain situations.  In addition, a means for
   discovering server behavior is needed.

   This memo updates <a href="rfc1939.html">RFC 1939</a> [POP3] to define a mechanism to announce
   support for optional commands, extensions, and unconditional server
   behavior.  Included is an initial set of currently deployed
   capabilities which vary between server implementations, and several
   new capabilities (SASL, RESP-CODES, LOGIN-DELAY, PIPELINING, EXPIRE
   and IMPLEMENTATION).  This document also extends POP3 error messages
   so that machine parsable codes can be provided to the client.  An
   initial set of response codes is included.  In addition, an [ABNF]
   specification of POP3 commands and responses is defined.

   Public comments should be sent to the IETF POP3 Extensions mailing
   list, &lt;<a href="mailto:ietf-pop3ext@imc.org">ietf-pop3ext@imc.org</a>&gt;.  To subscribe, send a message
   containing SUBSCRIBE to &lt;<a href="mailto:ietf-pop3ext-request@imc.org">ietf-pop3ext-request@imc.org</a>&gt;.

2.  Conventions Used in this Document

   The key words "REQUIRED", "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described in "Key
   words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [KEYWORDS].

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.

3.  General Command and Response Grammar

   The general form of POP3 commands and responses is described using
   [ABNF]:

   POP3 commands:

      command      =  keyword *(SP param) CRLF    ;255 octets maximum
      keyword      =  3*4VCHAR
      param        =  1*VCHAR

   POP3 responses:

      response     =  greeting / single-line / capa-resp / multi-line
      capa-resp    =  single-line *capability "." CRLF
      capa-tag     =  1*cchar
      capability   =  capa-tag *(SP param) CRLF   ;512 octets maximum
      cchar        =  %x21-2D / %x2F-7F
                          ;printable ASCII, excluding "."
      dot-stuffed  =  *CHAR CRLF                  ;must be dot-stuffed
      gchar        =  %x21-3B / %x3D-7F
                          ;printable ASCII, excluding "&lt;"
      greeting     =  "+OK" [resp-code] *gchar [timestamp] *gchar CRLF
                          ;512 octets maximum
      multi-line   =  single-line *dot-stuffed "." CRLF
      rchar        =  %x21-2E / %x30-5C / %x5E-7F
                          ;printable ASCII, excluding "/" and "]"
      resp-code    =  "[" resp-level *("/" resp-level) "]"
      resp-level   =  1*rchar
      schar        =  %x21-5A / %x5C-7F
                          ;printable ASCII, excluding "["
      single-line  =  status [SP text] CRLF       ;512 octets maximum
      status       =  "+OK" / "-ERR"
      text         =  *schar / resp-code *CHAR
      timestamp    =  "&lt;" *VCHAR "&gt;"
                          ;MUST conform to <a href="rfc822.html">RFC-822</a> msg-id

4.  Parameter and Response Lengths

   This specification increases the length restrictions on commands and
   parameters imposed by <a href="rfc1939.html">RFC 1939</a>.

   The maximum length of a command is increased from 47 characters (4
   character command, single space, 40 character argument, CRLF) to 255
   octets, including the terminating CRLF.

   Servers which support the CAPA command MUST support commands up to
   255 octets.  Servers MUST also support the largest maximum command
   length specified by any supported capability.

   The maximum length of the first line of a command response (including
   the initial greeting) is unchanged at 512 octets (including the
   terminating CRLF).

5.  The CAPA Command

   The POP3 CAPA command returns a list of capabilities supported by the
   POP3 server.  It is available in both the AUTHORIZATION and
   TRANSACTION states.

   A capability description MUST document in which states the capability
   is announced, and in which states the commands are valid.

   Capabilities available in the AUTHORIZATION state MUST be announced
   in both states.

   If a capability is announced in both states, but the argument might
   differ after authentication, this possibility MUST be stated in the
   capability description.

   (These requirements allow a client to issue only one CAPA command if
   it does not use any TRANSACTION-only capabilities, or any
   capabilities whose values may differ after authentication.)

   If the authentication step negotiates an integrity protection layer,
   the client SHOULD reissue the CAPA command after authenticating, to
   check for active down-negotiation attacks.

   Each capability may enable additional protocol commands, additional
   parameters and responses for existing commands, or describe an aspect
   of server behavior.  These details are specified in the description
   of the capability.

   Section 3 describes the CAPA response using [ABNF].  When a
   capability response describes an optional command, the &lt;capa-tag&gt;
   SHOULD be identical to the command keyword.  CAPA response tags are
   case-insensitive.

        CAPA

        Arguments:
            none

        Restrictions:
            none

        Discussion:
            An -ERR response indicates the capability command is not
            implemented and the client will have to probe for
            capabilities as before.

            An +OK response is followed by a list of capabilities, one
            per line.  Each capability name MAY be followed by a single
            space and a space-separated list of parameters.  Each
            capability line is limited to 512 octets (including the
            CRLF).  The capability list is terminated by a line
            containing a termination octet (".") and a CRLF pair.

         Possible Responses:
             +OK -ERR

         Examples:
             C: CAPA
             S: +OK Capability list follows
             S: TOP
             S: USER
             S: SASL CRAM-MD5 KERBEROS_V4
             S: RESP-CODES
             S: LOGIN-DELAY 900
             S: PIPELINING
             S: EXPIRE 60
             S: UIDL
             S: IMPLEMENTATION Shlemazle-Plotz-v302
             S: .

6.  Initial Set of Capabilities

   This section defines an initial set of POP3 capabilities.  These
   include the optional POP3 commands, already published POP3
   extensions, and behavior variations between POP3 servers which can
   impact clients.

   Note that there is no APOP capability, even though APOP is an
   optional command in [POP3].  Clients discover server support of APOP
   by the presence in the greeting banner of an initial challenge
   enclosed in angle brackets ("&lt;&gt;").  Therefore, an APOP capability
   would introduce two ways for a server to announce the same thing.

6.1.  TOP capability

   CAPA tag:
       TOP

   Arguments:
       none

   Added commands:
       TOP

   Standard commands affected:
       none

   Announced states / possible differences:
       both / no

   Commands valid in states:
       TRANSACTION

   Specification reference:
       [POP3]

   Discussion:
       The TOP capability indicates the optional TOP command is
       available.

6.2.  USER capability

   CAPA tag:
       USER

   Arguments:
       none

   Added commands:
       USER PASS

   Standard commands affected:
       none

   Announced states / possible differences:
       both / no

   Commands valid in states:
       AUTHENTICATION

   Specification reference:
       [POP3]

   Discussion:
       The USER capability indicates that the USER and PASS commands
       are supported, although they may not be available to all users.

6.3.  SASL capability

   CAPA tag:
       SASL

   Arguments:
       Supported SASL mechanisms

   Added commands:
       AUTH

   Standard commands affected:
       none

   Announced states / possible differences:
       both / no

   Commands valid in states:
       AUTHENTICATION

   Specification reference:
       [POP-AUTH, SASL]

   Discussion:
       The POP3 AUTH command [POP-AUTH] permits the use of [SASL]
       authentication mechanisms with POP3.  The SASL capability
       indicates that the AUTH command is available and that it supports
       an optional base64 encoded second argument for an initial client
       response as described in the SASL specification.  The argument to
       the SASL capability is a space separated list of SASL mechanisms
       which are supported.

6.4.  RESP-CODES capability

   CAPA tag:
       RESP-CODES

   Arguments:
       none

   Added commands:
       none

   Standard commands affected:

   Discussion:
       The RESP-CODES capability indicates that any response text issued
       by this server which begins with an open square bracket ("[") is
       an extended response code (see section 8).

6.5.  LOGIN-DELAY capability

   CAPA tag:
       LOGIN-DELAY

   Arguments:
       minimum seconds between logins; optionally followed by USER in
       AUTHENTICATION state.

   Added commands:
       none

   Standard commands affected:
       USER PASS APOP AUTH

   Announced states / possible differences:

<a href="rfc2449.html">RFC 2449</a>                POP3 Extension Mechanism           November 1998


   Specification reference:
       this document

   Discussion:
       POP3 clients often login frequently to check for new mail.
       Unfortunately, the process of creating a connection,
       authenticating the user, and opening the user's maildrop can be
       very resource intensive on the server.  A number of deployed POP3
       servers try to reduce server load by requiring a delay between
       logins.  The LOGIN-DELAY capability includes an integer argument
       which indicates the number of seconds after an "+OK" response to
       a PASS, APOP, or AUTH command before another authentication will
       be accepted.  Clients which permit the user to configure a mail
       check interval SHOULD use this capability to determine the
       minimum permissible interval.  Servers which advertise LOGIN-
       DELAY SHOULD enforce it.

       If the minimum login delay period could differ per user (that is,
       the LOGIN-DELAY argument might change after authentication), the
       server MUST announce in AUTHENTICATION state the largest value
       which could be set for any user.  This might be the largest value
       currently in use for any user (so only one value per server), or
       even the largest value which the server permits to be set for any
       user.  The server SHOULD append the token "USER" to the LOGIN-
       DELAY parameter in AUTHENTICATION state, to inform the client
       that a more accurate value is available after authentication.
       The server SHOULD announce the more accurate value in TRANSACTION
       state. (The "USER" token allows the client to decide if a second
       CAPA command is needed or not.)

       Servers enforce LOGIN-DELAY by rejecting an authentication
       command with or without the LOGIN-DELAY error response.  See
       section 8.1.1 for more information.

6.6.  PIPELINING capability

   CAPA tag:
       PIPELINING

   Arguments:
       none

   Added commands:
       none

   Standard commands affected:
       all

<a href="rfc2449.html">RFC 2449</a>                POP3 Extension Mechanism           November 1998


   Announced states / possible differences:
       both / no

   Commands valid in states:
       n/a

   Specification reference:
       this document

   Discussion:
       The PIPELINING capability indicates the server is capable of
       accepting multiple commands at a time; the client does not have
       to wait for the response to a command before issuing a subsequent
       command.  If a server supports PIPELINING, it MUST process each
       command in turn.  If a client uses PIPELINING, it MUST keep track
       of which commands it has outstanding, and match server responses
       to commands in order.  If either the client or server uses
       blocking writes, it MUST not exceed the window size of the
       underlying transport layer.

       Some POP3 clients have an option to indicate the server supports
       "Overlapped POP3 commands." This capability removes the need to
       configure this at the client.

       This is roughly synonymous with the ESMTP PIPELINING extension
       [PIPELINING], however, since SMTP [SMTP] tends to have short
       commands and responses, the benefit is in grouping multiple
       commands and sending them as a unit.  While there are cases of
       this in POP (for example, USER and PASS could be batched,
       multiple RETR and/or DELE commands could be sent as a group),
       because POP has short commands and sometimes lengthy responses,
       there is also an advantage is sending new commands while still
       receiving the response to an earlier command (for example,
       sending RETR and/or DELE commands while processing a UIDL reply).

6.7.  EXPIRE capability

   CAPA tag:
       EXPIRE

   Arguments:
       server-guaranteed minimum retention days, or NEVER; optionally
       followed by USER in AUTHENTICATION state

   Added commands:
       none

   Discussion:
       While POP3 allows clients to leave messages on the server, RFC
       1939 [POP3] warns about the problems that may arise from this,
       and allows servers to delete messages based on site policy.

       The EXPIRE capability avoids the problems mentioned in <a href="rfc1939.html">RFC 1939</a>,
       by allowing the server to inform the client as to the policy in
       effect.  The argument to the EXPIRE capability indicates the
       minimum server retention period, in days, for messages on the
       server.

       EXPIRE 0 indicates the client is not permitted to leave mail on
       the server; when the session enters the UPDATE state the server
       MAY assume an implicit DELE for each message which was downloaded
       with RETR.

       EXPIRE NEVER asserts that the server does not delete messages.

       The concept of a "retention period" is intentionally vague.
       Servers may start counting days to expiration when a message is
       added to a maildrop, when a client becomes aware of the existence
       of a message through the LIST or UIDL commands, when a message
       has been acted upon in some way (for example, TOP or RETR), or at
       some other event.  The EXPIRE capability cannot provide a precise
       indication as to exactly when any specific message will expire.
       The capability is intended to make it easier for clients to
       behave in ways which conform to site policy and user wishes.  For
       example, a client might display a warning for attempts to
       configure a "leave mail on server" period which is greater than
       or equal to some percentage of the value announced by the server.

       If a site uses any automatic deletion policy, it SHOULD use the
       EXPIRE capability to announce this.

       The EXPIRE capability, with a parameter other than 0 or NEVER, is
       intended to let the client know that the server does permit mail
       to be left on the server, and to
